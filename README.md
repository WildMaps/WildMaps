# WildMaps

WildMaps is a project that aims to collect and visualize biodiversity data in hiking areas of the Patagonia region. Through the use of mobile applications and web platforms, WildMaps enables users to contribute to scientific research, environmental conservation, and the promotion of biodiversity knowledge.

## Project Overview

WildMaps seeks to engage outdoor enthusiasts, nature lovers, and citizen scientists in the collection and documentation of flora and fauna species found in the Patagonian wilderness. By combining the power of technology, community participation, and artificial intelligence, our project strives to create a comprehensive database that can aid in the understanding and preservation of the region's diverse ecosystems.

## Key Features

- **Trail Scanner Mobile Apps**: The Trail Scanner mobile applications allow users to record sightings of flora and fauna species during their hiking trips. Users can capture photos, geotag locations, and provide additional information about each observation.

- **Web Platform**: The WildMaps web platform serves as a centralized hub for storing, visualizing, and analyzing the collected biodiversity data. It provides interactive maps, detailed species profiles, and various tools for exploring and contributing to the dataset.

- **Citizen Science**: WildMaps promotes citizen science by involving the general public in data collection. By empowering individuals to become active contributors, we aim to foster a sense of environmental responsibility and increase awareness about the importance of biodiversity conservation.

- **Artificial Intelligence**: The project leverages artificial intelligence techniques to process and analyze the collected data. Machine learning models are trained to identify species, classify observations, and generate valuable insights for researchers and conservationists.
